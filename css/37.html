<p>Insertion anomalies are issues that come about when you are inserting information into 
the database for the first time. To insert the information into the table, we must enter 
the correct details so that they are consistent with the values for the other rows. Missing 
or incorrectly formatted entries are two of the more common insertion errors. Most
developers acknowledge that this will happen and build in error codes that tell you 
exactly what went wrong
